## The Decision
I left my previous job after 6 years. By the time I left, I have participated in 3-4 revamp projects, ranging from infrastruture to applications. Like a typical revamp projects, everybody from IT to business was very motivated at the beginning. We all had great visions and high hopes for the new systems. However, after we got the requirements clear and tendering process sorted out, at least **half a year** had passed since the commencement of the project.

But nothing compares to the **year-long** development. By the time when first UAT arrived, business users had forgotten much of the detailed requirements. Trying the new system for the **first time** after 1.5 years, they started to wonder whether certain **changes** can be made.

Internally within IT, manual testing result was even more troubling,
- System bugs
- Absence of automated testing
- Inconsistencies between releases
- Performance issues
- Security concerns (many libraries requires upgrade)
- etc...the list goes on

Now IT not only has to fix the bugs, but also need to work on the changed requirements. Afterall, what use does the new system have if it cannot perform better than the old one?

What comes next must not be foreign to many of us. Each release is now followed by intensive manual testing and issue reporting. There were so much testing to do, sometimes we had to pull in people who had little knowledge of the system. As a result, exensive effort is required to produce and maintain and the test documentations such that EVERYONE is able to just take it and execute it.

What about test reports, progress tracking and reconcililing? It was all too manual and painful. We simply couldn't release fast enough to catch-up with the ever growing list. Release dates missed, relationships tensed.

Some of these projects went to PRODUCTION eventually, but followed immediately by days' if not weeks' of fire-fighting. Some, didn't make it and may never will.

After history repeats itself again and again, I can't stop thinking: `Is this the best we can do?`.

I know waterfall doesn't work in today's time and we have to be TRUELY AGILE. But HOW?
- What are the best practices?
- What are the tools we can use at each process?
- What else is involved besides the right tools?

That's when I decided to leave and see for myself how modern techologies help with these challenges. Not only to know them, but also to master some.

## A Year Later
ThoughtWorks is a company where many of the Agile practices originated from. During this one year, I have worked on a few projects that really exposed me to many of modern technologies. Here I have listed a few libraries and services that I have used, ranging from self-exploration to real client projects.

Althought I am more familiar with some more than the others, I am far from an expert in many areas. However the point to show the enormous amount of knowledge out there waiting to acquired in order to be proficient in today's IT world. And the knowledge base is ever growing. I don't think it's possible for anyone to be expert in all of these aspects but it is certainly beneficial to have a bit of knowledge in as many things as possbile.

## Moving Forward
Technology is advancing so fast and learning should never cease. However I do feel overwhelmed sometimes by the amount of new things out there. Will I be able to keep up with the learning pace, say 15 or 20 years from now?

I don't have the answer but I am happy to be just better than yesterday, even just a little.
Happy anniversary!
