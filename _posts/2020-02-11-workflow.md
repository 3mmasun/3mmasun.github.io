# General Workflow in Steps (WIP)

Below are the general steps I learnt from the Machine Learning course, to be updated as the course progress

- Define problem statement
- Gather data (eg, data lake, data pipeline)
- Exploring data
  - null inspection
  - pair plot (correlation between features)
  - shape
  - data type
- Data cleansing
  - fill na
  - one-hot loading
  - etc
- Build baseline model, perhaps using linear regression
- Iterative Process
  - P-value inspection
  - Feature Selection
  - Feature Scaling & Normalization
  - Feature Engineering, eg: for polynomial regression
  - Prepare Data set: training, testing, holdout
  - Train the model with cross validation
  - Model evaluation
    - R<sup>2</sup> score as a function of polynomial degree
